# Recommendation with IBM

### Purpose 
This is Udacity Data Scientist Nano-degree Project. The goal is to make recommendations of articles to users. This one starts with an ipynb notebook provided in the course and relatively straightforward to do compared to previous projects. 

### Main Files
Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: The main submission file.  
data/:  The data folder.  
Other files are provided in the course for checking the results

This file mainly contains a simple EDA, rank-based, user-user based CF, and SVD based recommendations. It calls no other existing library of recommendation, so it's a good exercise to learn how to code these up from scratch. 

### Libraries used
* python==3.9.13
* pandas==1.4.0
* numpy==1.23.3
* scikit-learn==1.0.2
